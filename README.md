# Drinctet

## Glossary

A card is a data entry that provides information to be displayed.

A "slide" in Drinctet is a visual representation that calls for an action from the users. Slides may use cards, but they don't have to.

## Cards

### DareCard

`{player1}` is selected by the slide, so it can be referred to. Be careful, if you want to refer to other players, start with `{player2}`.

## Interpolated text rules

Indexes start at 1 (so the first player is player 1 which sounds more natural). If no index is given, this default index will be used.
